### Summary
***
This arcade game is a version of the classic Frogger game that tests the player's ability to cross a road and reach the other side of the margin while avoiding random moving enemies. In this particular Arcade Game project, there are 3 enemy rows in which the enemies show up in random velocities. Game ends when player reaches the water side.
A game powered by OOJS+Canvas♥!

### Goal
***
This project aims to test each student's ability to implement Object Oriented Javascript and Canvas knowledge by using some ready-made functions, non-interactive html/css files and coding a fully interactive Arcade Game app.
